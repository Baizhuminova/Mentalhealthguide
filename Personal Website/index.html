       <h2 class="intro-title"> Why is it important to take care of mental health ?</h2>
         <div class="intro-text">
           <p>The term "mental health", as well as the synonymous concept of "psychological health", refers to the mental well-being of a person in the broad sense of the word. If a person is psychologically healthy, he can fully enjoy life, feel the meaning of his existence, cope with professional and other tasks, love, work and build relationships with others.</p>
            <hr style="width:50%;text-align:center; height:0.1px;color:black;">

                   <p>  Mental health can be disrupted for various reasons: prolonged stress, family problems, personal grief, even a traumatic brain injury can lead to such problems. They manifest themselves in different ways - from a simple decrease in self-esteem and a long period of bad mood to neuroses and even mental illness. If you notice problems that prevent you from living a full life, then you should contact specialists. Depending on the specific problem, it is better to go to a psychologist, psychotherapist or psychiatrist. </p>

            <hr style="width:50%; text-align:center; height:0.1px;color:black;">
                   <p>There is such a thing as psychohygiena. It includes a large set of measures that will help, if possible, avoid contacting a specialist. We must consciously approach life and the events that affect us. Choose the stress prevention methods that are suitable for you personally on our website</p>
